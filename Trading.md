EXCHANGE RATE AND BASE CURRENCY

The factor of currency a to b, and conversely, the factor of currency b to a.

The base currency is the currency for which exchange rates are quoted relative to other currencies. For example, if we quote Fab, currency A is the base currency, and the rate tells us how much of currency B is equivalent to one unit of currency A.

SPREAD

    The difference between the inverse of exchange rate b to a and the exchange rate of a to b:
        1/Fbs = Fab + Spread
        -Fba(Fab + Spread) = 1

    The exchange of Fba is the inverse of Fab plus the spread.

PROFIT OF TRADE

    Take trade of currency a to b with opening exchange rate Fab', and investment A (in currency a) converted to B units of currency b = A(Fab').

    The return is the conversion of B to units of currency a, as per the closing exchange rate of Fba".
        B(Fba") = A(Fab')(Fba")
        Return = A(Fab')(Fba")

    The profit of trade is the difference between the return and the initial investment.
        Profit = A[Fab'(Fba") - 1]
        Expressed in terms of Fab"
        Profit = A[Fab' / (Fab" + Spread) - 1]

    The profit expressed in terms of currency of investment (N) and currency of profit (P):
        A = N(Fna')
        P = Profit(Fap")
        Profit (currency P) = N(Fna')(Fap")[Fab' / (Fab" + Spread) - 1]

TRIFECA RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THREE CURRENCIES

SELLING/BORROWING

    The trade involves exchanging currency A for currency B, where currency A is borrowed. The borrowing fee is defined as the factor (C%) of the borrowed amount A.

    True Profit Calculation
    The True Profit (or Loss) is calculated by deducting the borrowing fee from the Trade Profit:
        True Profit = Trade Profit - A * C%
        True Profit = A * (Fab' / (Fab" + Spread) - (1 + C%))

    Amount gained derivation
    If the Trade Profit is greater than or equal to the Borrowing Fee, the gains expressed in terms of currency P are calculated as follows:
        Where Fab' is the opening exchange rate of currency A to currency B, and Fab" is the closing exchange rate of currency A to currency B.
        If (Fab' / (Fab" + Spread)) â‰¥ (C% + 1), then:
        Gains = A * Fna * Fap" * (Fab' / (Fab" + Spread) - (1 + C%))
        Here, Fap" is the closing exchange rate of the borrowed amount currency A to currency P.

    Amount Owed Calculation
    If the Trade Profit is less than the Borrowing Fee, the amount owed expressed in terms of currency P is calculated as follows:
        If (Fab' / (Fab" + Spread)) < (C% + 1), then:
        Loss = [A * Fna / Fpa"] * (Fab' / (Fab" + Spread) - (1 + C%))
        Here, Fpa" is the closing exchange rate of currency P to the borrowed amount currency A.
