1. The weighing problem consists of identifying a unique item with a distinct mass within a specified set of items, where all but one item possess an equal weight. Utilizing a balanced scale, the objective is to ascertain the minimum number of weighings required to identify the item with the differing mass. The weight on each side of the balance scale is determined by both the quantity of items and the individual mass of each item.

2. Initially, we ensure that both sides of the balance contain an equal number of items, thereby creating subsets from the total quantity of items. This arrangement facilitates the detection of weight discrepancies attributable solely to the unique item's mass, rather than the quantity of items on each side.

3. Each weighing attempt yields two potential outcomes. The first outcome occurs when both sides of the balance are equal, thereby eliminating the possibility that the unique mass is present on either side. The second outcome arises when a discrepancy is observed, indicating that the side with greater or lesser mass contains the unique item. The direction of this imbalance will depend on whether the unique item is heavier or lighter than the remaining items, which all share an equal mass.

4. For any total quantity of items greater than two, the number of subsets to be weighed can be determined by calculating the quotient obtained by dividing the total quantity by 2. The minimum quotient will be 1 (applicable when there are three items), while the maximum quotient corresponds to the largest integer such that the remainder is less than the divisor. Considering the two potential outcomes outlined in paragraph 3, the subsets that will be weighed will consist either of the items represented by the quotient or the remaining item indicated by the remainder.
