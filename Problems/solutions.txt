PROBLEM 3: If p = a^2 + b^2 is a prime number greater than 2, then p must be of the form 4k + 1, where k is an integer.

Proof:

    Assumptions:
    Suppose p = a^2 + b^2 is a prime number, and p > 2. We need to show that p must be of the form 4k + 1 for some integer k.

    Parity Analysis:
    Since p is a prime number greater than 2, it must be odd, because 2 is the only even prime. Therefore, a^2 + b^2 cannot be divisible by 4. This means that at least one of a or b must be odd.

    Without loss of generality, assume that a is even and b is odd. If this assumption is incorrect, we could swap a and b because the argument is symmetric.

    Form of a and b:
    Since a is even, we can write a = 2m for some integer m. Since b is odd, we can write b = 2n + 1 for some integer n.

    Computing a^2 + b^2:
    Substitute these expressions for a and b into a^2 + b^2: a^2 + b^2 = (2m)^2 + (2n+1)^2 = 4m^2 + (4n^2 + 4n + 1).
    Simplifying, we get:
    a^2 + b^2 = 4m^2 + 4n^2 + 4n + 1 = 4(m^2 + n^2 + n) + 1.
    So, a^2 + b^2 = 4k + 1, where k = m^2 + n^2 + n.

    Conclusion:
    Since a^2 + b^2 = 4k + 1, we see that p is of the form 4k + 1 for some integer k. This is exactly the form of primes that can be expressed as the sum of two squares. According to Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares, a prime p > 2 can be written as the sum of two squares if and only if p ≡ 1 (mod 4).

Therefore, we have shown that if p = a^2 + b^2 is a prime greater than 2, then p must be of the form 4k + 1, as required.

SIMPLER SOLUTION

Claim: If p = a^2 + b^2 is a prime number greater than 2, then p must be of the form 4k + 1, where k is an integer.
Proof:

    Quadratic Residues Modulo 4:
    First, recall that when squaring an integer modulo 4, the possible results (called quadratic residues modulo 4) are limited. Specifically, for any integer x, we have:
        If x ≡ 0 (mod 4), then x^2 ≡ 0 (mod 4),
        If x ≡ 1 (mod 4), then x^2 ≡ 1 (mod 4),
        If x ≡ 2 (mod 4), then x^2 ≡ 0 (mod 4),
        If x ≡ 3 (mod 4), then x^2 ≡ 1 (mod 4).

    Therefore, the square of any integer x is either congruent to 0 (mod 4) or 1 (mod 4).

    Sum of Squares:
    Since p = a^2 + b^2, we now look at the possible values of a^2 and b^2 modulo 4. From the previous step, we know:
        If a is even, a^2 ≡ 0 (mod 4),
        If a is odd, a^2 ≡ 1 (mod 4),
        Similarly for b, we have b^2 ≡ 0 (mod 4) if b is even and b^2 ≡ 1 (mod 4) if b is odd.

    Analyzing the Possible Cases:
    Now, consider the different cases for a^2 + b^2 modulo 4:
        If both a and b are even, then a^2 + b^2 ≡ 0 + 0 = 0 (mod 4), which cannot be prime because it's divisible by 4.
        If a is even and b is odd, then a^2 + b^2 ≡ 0 + 1 = 1 (mod 4).
        If a is odd and b is even, then a^2 + b^2 ≡ 1 + 0 = 1 (mod 4).
        If both a and b are odd, then a^2 + b^2 ≡ 1 + 1 = 2 (mod 4), which cannot be prime because it’s divisible by 2.

    Thus, the only possibility for p = a^2 + b^2 to be prime is if p ≡ 1 (mod 4).

    Conclusion:
    Since p = a^2 + b^2 and the only case where the sum of squares results in a prime number is when p ≡ 1 (mod 4), it follows that if p is prime and can be written as the sum of two squares, then p must be of the form 4k + 1, where k is some integer.
