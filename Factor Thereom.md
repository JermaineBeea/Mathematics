Here's the rewritten statement in plain text format:

Let 2^k + 1 be a number, where 2^b + 1 is one of its factors, and k > b. If 2^b + 1 is a factor of 2^k + 1, then the factorization can be written as:

2^k + 1 = (2^b + 1) * (2^a + 2^(a+1) + ... + 2^n)

For this factorization, the values of k, a, and n are:

k = 3b  
a = b  
n = 2b - 1

This means that 2^k + 1 can be factored into 2^b + 1 when k = 3b, with specific values for a and n.
